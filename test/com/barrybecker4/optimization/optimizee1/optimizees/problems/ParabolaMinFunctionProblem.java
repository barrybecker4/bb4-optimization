/**
 * This is a simple search space to test the optimization package.
 * The function we will try to minimize is
 *
 *   z = (1 - p1)^2 + (2 - p2)^2
 *
 * Normally we have no idea what the real function is that we are trying to optimize.
 * Nor is a real life function likely to be as well behaved as this one is.
 * This function is very smooth (actually infinitely differentiable) - which is a
 * feature that makes hill-climbing algorithms work very well on.
 * For this simple case, I intentionally use a simple polynomial function with only
 * 2 parameters so that I can solve it analytically and compare it to the optimization results.
 * For this function the global maximum is 1 and it occurs only when p1 = 1 and p2 = 2.
 * There are no other local maxima. The shape of the surface formed by this function
 * is an inverted parabola centered at p1 = 1 and p2 = 2.
 *
 * There are a few variations on the analytic function to choose from, but they all have the same solution.
 * @see SevenElevenProblem for somewhat harder example.
