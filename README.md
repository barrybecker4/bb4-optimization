# bb4-optimization

A collection of heuristic optimization algorithms.
The algorithms are implemented mostly as described by Michalewicz and Fogel in ["How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics"](http://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-It-Modern-Heuristics/dp/3540224947)

### How to Build
Type 'gradlew build' at the root (or ./gradlew if running in Cygwin). This is mainly a library project, but there are several interesting test cases that can be viewed visually.
If you want to open the source in Intellij, then first run 'gradlew idea'.
There is a simple visualization of a trivial optimization problem that can be viewed by running 'gradlew run'.

When there is a new release, versioned artifacts will be published by Barry Becker to [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org).
