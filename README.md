# bb4-optimization

A collection of heuristic optimization algorithms.
The algorithms are implemented mostly as described by Michalewicz and Fogel in ["How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics"](http://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-It-Modern-Heuristics/dp/3540224947)

### How to Build
Type 'gradle build' at the root. This is mainly a library project, but there are several interesting test cases that can be viewed visually.
If you want to open the source in Intellij, then first run 'gradle idea'.

When there is a new release, versioned artifacts will be published by Barry Becker to [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org).
